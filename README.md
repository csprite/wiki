# [csprite.github.io/wiki](https://csprite.github.io/wiki)
wiki for my pixel art editor, uses a custom script [`RenderMarkdown.js`](./RenderMarkdown.js) instead of jekyll as versioning in jekyll is painful

## Development

You'll Need NodeJs Installed, then install dependencies with `npm i` & build the content with:

```bash
npm test
```

you can view the built content with:
- Python3: `python3 -m http.server --directory ./dist/`
- NodeJs: `npx --yes http-server ./dist/`
